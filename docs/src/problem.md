Our user, Jenny, is a happy manager that is in charge of the logitics team in
a shipping company.

She is lately feeling a bit anxious and worried because her company would not be
able to
deliver to their key business partners. She is not able to allocate time to go
and read through all the feds in their digital gadgets.

It is hard for most people to keep with the political incertanties, due to lack
of time to build the required knowledge to navigate in today's news outlets.
